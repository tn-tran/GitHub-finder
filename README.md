My focus is on learning to create a simple yet smooth UI/UX and dealing with APIs.

## Optimizations

The optimizations I improved on were the images fetched from Github's servers by decreasing the limit of images it fetched, resulting in fewer images fetched at a single time.

## Lessons Learned

The UI mustn't get blocked from an API call, or it'll result in a bad user experience. Be careful of jumping straight to the code without thinking about the possible edge cases.
